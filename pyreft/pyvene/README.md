# A Library for _Understanding_ and _Improving_ PyTorch Models via Interventions
Interventions on model-internal states are fundamental operations in many areas of AI, including model editing, steering, robustness, and interpretability. To facilitate such research, we introduce **pyvene**, an open-source Python library that supports customizable interventions on a range of different PyTorch modules. **pyvene** supports complex intervention schemes with an intuitive configuration format, and its interventions can be static or include trainable parameters.

**Getting Started:** [<img align="center" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" />](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stanfordnlp/pyvene/blob/main/pyvene_101.ipynb) [**Main _pyvene_ 101**]  

## Installation
Since we are currently beta-testing, it is recommended to install pyvene by,
```bash
git clone git@github.com:stanfordnlp/pyvene.git
```
and add pyvene into your system path in python via,
```py
import sys
sys.path.append("<Your Path to Pyvene>")

import pyvene as pv
```
Alternatively, you can do
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyvene.git
```
or 
```bash
pip install pyvene
```

## _Wrap_ , _Intervene_ and _Share_
You can intervene with any HuggingFace model as,
```python
import torch
import pyvene as pv
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf" # your HF model name.
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="cuda")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

def zeroout_intervention_fn(b, s): 
    b[:,3] = 0. # 3rd position
    return b

pv_model = pv.IntervenableModel({
    "component": "model.layers[15].mlp.output", # string access
    "intervention": zeroout_intervention_fn}, model=model)

# run the intervened forward pass
orig_outputs, intervened_outputs = pv_model(
    tokenizer("The capital of Spain is", return_tensors="pt").to('cuda'),
    output_original_output=True
)
print(intervened_outputs.logits - orig_outputs.logits)
```
which returns,
```
tensor([[[ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  ...,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],
         [ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  ...,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],
         [ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  ...,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],
         [ 0.4375,  1.0625,  0.3750,  ..., -0.1562,  0.4844,  0.2969],
         [ 0.0938,  0.1250,  0.1875,  ...,  0.2031,  0.0625,  0.2188],
         [ 0.0000, -0.0625, -0.0312,  ...,  0.0000,  0.0000, -0.0156]]],
       device='cuda:0')
```

## _IntervenableModel_ Loaded from HuggingFace Directly
The following codeblock can reproduce [honest_llama-2 chat](https://github.com/likenneth/honest_llama/tree/master) from the paper [Inference-Time Intervention: Eliciting Truthful Answers from a Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03341). The added activations are only **~0.14MB** on disk!

```python
# others can download from huggingface and use it directly
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import pyvene as pv

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
).to("cuda")

pv_model = pv.IntervenableModel.load(
    "zhengxuanzenwu/intervenable_honest_llama2_chat_7B", # the activation diff ~0.14MB
    model,
)

print("llama-2-chat loaded with interventions:")
q = "What's a cure for insomnia that always works?"
prompt = tokenizer(q, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
_, iti_response_shared = pv_model.generate(prompt, max_new_tokens=64, do_sample=False)
print(tokenizer.decode(iti_response_shared[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
With this, once you discover some clever intervention schemes, you can share with others quickly without sharing the actual base LMs or the intervention code!


## _IntervenableModel_ as Regular _nn.Module_
You can also use the `pv_gpt2` just like a regular torch model component inside another model, or another pipeline as,
```py
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple, Union, Dict

class ModelWithIntervenables(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelWithIntervenables, self).__init__()
        self.pv_gpt2 = pv_gpt2
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(768, 1)
        # Your other downstream components go here

    def forward(
        self, 
        base,
        sources: Optional[List] = None,
        unit_locations: Optional[Dict] = None,
        activations_sources: Optional[Dict] = None,
        subspaces: Optional[List] = None,
    ):
        _, counterfactual_x = self.pv_gpt2(
            base,
            sources,
            unit_locations,
            activations_sources,
            subspaces
        )
        return self.fc(self.relu(counterfactual_x.last_hidden_state))
```

## Complex _Intervention Schema_ as an _Object_
One key abstraction that **pyvene** provides is the encapsulation of the intervention schema. While abstraction provides good user-interfact, **pyvene** can support relatively complex intervention schema. The following helper function generates the schema configuration for *path patching* on individual attention heads on the output of the OV circuit (i.e., analyzing causal effect of each individual component):
```py
import pyvene as pv

def path_patching_config(
    layer, last_layer, 
    component="head_attention_value_output", unit="h.pos", 
):
    intervening_component = [
        {"layer": layer, "component": component, "unit": unit, "group_key": 0}]
    restoring_components = []
    if not stream.startswith("mlp_"):
        restoring_components += [
            {"layer": layer, "component": "mlp_output", "group_key": 1}]
    for i in range(layer+1, last_layer):
        restoring_components += [
            {"layer": i, "component": "attention_output", "group_key": 1}
            {"layer": i, "component": "mlp_output", "group_key": 1}
        ]
    intervenable_config = IntervenableConfig(intervening_component + restoring_components)
    return intervenable_config
```
then you can wrap the config generated by this function to a model. And after you have done your intervention, you can share your path patching with others,
```py
_, tokenizer, gpt2 = pv.create_gpt2()

pv_gpt2 = pv.IntervenableModel(
    path_patching_config(4, gpt2.config.n_layer), 
    model=gpt2
)
# saving the path
pv_gpt2.save(
    save_directory="./your_gpt2_path/"
)
# loading the path
pv_gpt2 = pv.IntervenableModel.load(
    "./tmp/",
    model=gpt2)
```

## A Little Guide for Causal Abstraction: From Interventions to Gain Interpretability Insights
Basic interventions are fun but we cannot make any causal claim systematically. To gain actual interpretability insights, we want to measure the counterfactual behaviors of a model in a data-driven fashion. In other words, if the model responds systematically to your interventions, then you start to associate certain regions in the network with a high-level concept. We also call this alignment search process with model internals.

### Understanding Causal Mechanisms with Static Interventions
Here is a more concrete example,
```py
def add_three_numbers(a, b, c):
    var_x = a + b
    return var_x + c
```
The function solves a 3-digit sum problem. Let's say, we trained a neural network to solve this problem perfectly. "Can we find the representation of (a + b) in the neural network?". We can use this library to answer this question. Specifically, we can do the following,

- **Step 1:** Form Interpretability (Alignment) Hypothesis: We hypothesize that a set of neurons N aligns with (a + b).
- **Step 2:** Counterfactual Testings: If our hypothesis is correct, then swapping neurons N between examples would give us expected counterfactual behaviors. For instance, the values of N for (1+2)+3, when swapping with N for (2+3)+4, the output should be (2+3)+3 or (1+2)+4 depending on the direction of the swap.
- **Step 3:** Reject Sampling of Hypothesis: Running tests multiple times and aggregating statistics in terms of counterfactual behavior matching. Proposing a new hypothesis based on the results. 

To translate the above steps into API calls with the library, it will be a single call,
```py
intervenable.eval_alignment(
    train_dataloader=test_dataloader,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    inputs_collator=inputs_collator
)
```
where you provide testing data (basically interventional data and the counterfactual behavior you are looking for) along with your metrics functions. The library will try to evaluate the alignment with the intervention you specified in the config.

--- 

### Understanding Causal Mechanism with Trainable Interventions
The alignment searching process outlined above can be tedious when your neural network is large. For a single hypothesized alignment, you basically need to set up different intervention configs targeting different layers and positions to verify your hypothesis. Instead of doing this brute-force search process, you can turn it into an optimization problem which also has other benefits such as distributed alignments.

In its crux, we basically want to train an intervention to have our desired counterfactual behaviors in mind. And if we can indeed train such interventions, we claim that causally informative information should live in the intervening representations! Below, we show one type of trainable intervention `models.interventions.RotatedSpaceIntervention` as,
```py
class RotatedSpaceIntervention(TrainableIntervention):
    
    """Intervention in the rotated space."""
    def forward(self, base, source):
        rotated_base = self.rotate_layer(base)
        rotated_source = self.rotate_layer(source)
        # interchange
        rotated_base[:self.interchange_dim] = rotated_source[:self.interchange_dim]
        # inverse base
        output = torch.matmul(rotated_base, self.rotate_layer.weight.T)
        return output
```
Instead of activation swapping in the original representation space, we first **rotate** them, and then do the swap followed by un-rotating the intervened representation. Additionally, we try to use SGD to **learn a rotation** that lets us produce expected counterfactual behavior. If we can find such rotation, we claim there is an alignment. `If the cost is between X and Y.ipynb` tutorial covers this with an advanced version of distributed alignment search, [Boundless DAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08809). There are [recent works](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RFtkRXHebkwxygDe2/an-interpretability-illusion-for-activation-patching-of) outlining potential limitations of doing a distributed alignment search as well.

You can now also make a single API call to train your intervention,
```py
intervenable.train_alignment(
    train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
    compute_loss=compute_loss,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    inputs_collator=inputs_collator
)
```
where you need to pass in a trainable dataset, and your customized loss and metrics function. The trainable interventions can later be saved on to your disk. You can also use `intervenable.evaluate()` your interventions in terms of customized objectives.
