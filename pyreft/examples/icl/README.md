# In-context learning (ICL) and ReFT

Based on the script [`reft_icl.ipynb`](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft/blob/main/examples/icl/reft_icl.ipynb).

ReFT requires minimum training parameters, and what if ReFT is also quick and easy to adapt to a new task? Here, we explore the limit of ReFT in an ICL learning algorithm which requires training with very limited examples.
